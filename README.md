# Emissions-Index
The Power Sector Carbon Index provides an estimate of the carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) intensity of the U.S. power sector using publicly available data sources. Carbon intensity is measured in pounds of CO<sub>2</sub> per Megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity. The index was created by researchers in Carnegie Mellon Universityâ€™s Scott Institute for Energy Innovation, with support from Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems.
